## Thanks

I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the module, bugfixers, testers, clients who use the module and everyone that submits new features.

A big thanks goes out to [Jan DÃ¼sedau](http://eformation.de) for drawing the custom icon set for the form fields.

All methods, with `public` visibility, are part of the public API. All other methods are not part of the public API. Where possible, we'll try to keep `protected` methods backwards-compatible in minor/patch versions, but if you're overriding methods then please test your work before upgrading.
