# UserForms

UserForms enables CMS users to create dynamic forms via a drag and drop interface
and without getting involved in any PHP code.

## Features

- Construct a form using all major form fields (text, email, dropdown, radio, checkbox..)
- Ability to extend userforms from other modules to provide extra fields.
- Ability to email multiple people the form submission
- Custom email templates
- View submitted submissions and export them to CSV
- Define custom error messages and validation settings
- Optionally display and hide fields using JavaScript based on users input

## Thanks

I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the module, bugfixers,
testers, clients who use the module and everyone that submits new features.

A big thanks goes out to [Jan Düsedau](http://eformation.de) for drawing
the custom icon set for the form fields.
