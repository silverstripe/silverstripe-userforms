 * This extension provides a hook that runs during a dev/build which will check for existing data in various
 * polymorphic relationship fields for userforms models, and ensure that the data is correct.
 *
 * Various `Parent` relationships in silverstripe/userforms for SilverStripe 3 were mapped directly to UserDefinedForm
 * instances, and were made polymorphic in SilverStripe 4 (which also requires a class name). This means that a
 * certain amount of manual checking is required to ensure that upgrades are performed smoothly.
 *
 * @internal This API is likely to be removed in later major versions of silverstripe/userforms
